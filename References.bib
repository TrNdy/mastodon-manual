	abstract = {New methods for clearing and expansion of biological objects create large, transparent samples that can be rapidly imaged using light-sheet microscopy. Resulting image acquisitions are terabytes in size and consist of many large, unaligned image tiles that suffer from optical distortions. We developed the BigStitcher software that efficiently handles and reconstructs large multi-tile, multi-view acquisitions compensating all major optical effects, thereby making single-cell resolved whole-organ datasets amenable to biological studies.},

@article{MaMuT,
	Abstract = {During development, coordinated cell behaviors orchestrate tissue and organ morphogenesis. Detailed descriptions of cell lineages and behaviors provide a powerful framework to elucidate the mechanisms of morphogenesis. To study the cellular basis of limb development, we imaged transgenic fluorescently-labeled embryos from the crustacean \textit{Parhyale hawaiensis} with multi-view light-sheet microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution over several days of embryogenesis. The cell lineage of outgrowing thoracic limbs was reconstructed at single-cell resolution with new software called Massive Multi-view Tracker (MaMuT). In silico clonal analyses suggested that the early limb primordium becomes subdivided into anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral compartments whose boundaries intersect at the distal tip of the growing limb. Limb-bud formation is associated with spatial modulation of cell proliferation, while limb elongation is also driven by preferential orientation of cell divisions along the proximal-distal growth axis. Cellular reconstructions were predictive of the expression patterns of limb development genes including the BMP morphogen Decapentaplegic.},
