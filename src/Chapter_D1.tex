\section{Mastodon numerical features.}
\label{FeaturesExplanation}

This chapter describes how the feature values currently available in Mastodon are calculated. 
We also gives information about their dimension, units, \etc.

\subsection{Feature dimensions.}

In Mastodon, feature values are expressed when possible in physical units. 
Each feature projection as a \textit{dimension} (in the physics meaning) from which we compute the \textit{units} of the values.
For instance, if a feature value as the dimension \texttt{LENGTH} and the spatial units is µm, then the values of this feature will be in~µm.
Mastodon only has physical units for space. 
For time, the frame interval is always equal to the dummy \texttt{1~frame}.
This is why you will find all units involving time expressed in \texttt{frame}s.
Each feature projection has a dimension, and the features report what are the dimension of their projections in the feature computation dialog (Figure~\ref{fig:FindFeatureDimension}).
The Table~\ref{tab:FeatureDimensions} lists all the feature dimensions currently supported in Mastodon, and give examples of the derived units when the spatial units are~µm.

\subsection{Spot features.}

\subsubsection{Spot gaussian-filtered intensity.}

This feature has two projections per channel, \textbf{Mean} and \textbf{Std}.
The values are floating point numbers, with the dimension \texttt{Intensity}.

The \textbf{Mean} projections give the average intensity at the center of the spot.
The average is calculated by taking the mean intensity inside the spot, weighted by a gaussian centered on the spot.
The size of the gaussian is adapted to fit into the smallest radius of the spot.
The Figure~\ref{fig:SpotGaussWeights} illustrates the Gaussian weights in the average for several spots.

The \textbf{Std} projections give the standard deviation of these means. 
The standard deviation is also weighted by the Gaussian.

\subsubsection{Spot median intensity.}

There is one projection of this feature per channel.
It reports the median intensity in the center of the spot for each channel.
The median is calculated inside a box that fits in the smallest radius of the ellipsoid.
The Figure~\ref{fig:SpotMedianBox} illustrates what this box looks like for several spots.

\subsection{Link features.}

\subsection{Track features.}

'Track' is the vocable we use in Mastodon for the weakly connected components of the graph.
A track is made of all the links and spots that can be reached by jumping across links in any direction.
In a lineage, a track corresponds to a single cell and all its daughters, grand-daughters, \etc.
Track feature are value that are defined for a whole track. 
An example would be the number of spots in a track.
In Mastodon, there is no special place to store track feature values.
Track feature values are stored in the spots of the tracks, and listed in spot features.
By convention, their name starts with \textbf{Track} and spot features starts with \textbf{Spot}.
