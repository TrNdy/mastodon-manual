    Target spot id &
    Stores the IDs of the two spots the link connects to. 
    In Mastodon, the links are oriented: the source and target are not equivalent. 
    By convention in Mastodon, the source spot is always the first in time, and the target the last in time.
    \\ \midrule

    \multicolumn{2}{l|}{Link displacement} & 
    The distance between the source and target spots of the links, in physical units.
    \\ \midrule
    
    \multicolumn{2}{l|}{Link velocity} & 
    The velocity at the time of the link.
    It is calculated as the link displacement divided by the frame interval between the source and target spots (in \texttt{frame} units).
